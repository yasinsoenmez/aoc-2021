# Advent of Code 2021 (aoc-2021)
Advent of Code 2021 done in Rust. Notes about Rust.
## Day 1
* Comparison of `Option` values are possible, so there is no need for `unwrap()`. `Some(_)` is greater than `None`.
* Used `windows()` for iterating over continguous window. There are other similar methods but are part of unstable Rust or *itertools* crate like `array_windows()` or `tuple_windows()`.

## Day 2
* No notes yet.
